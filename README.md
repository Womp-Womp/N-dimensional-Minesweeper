# N-dimensional Minesweeper

This project is an ambitious take on the classic Minesweeper game, extending the challenge into N dimensions. Built with Rust, the goal is to create a fun, mind-bending puzzle game that tests your spatial reasoning in ways you've never experienced before.

Imagine sweeping for mines not just on a flat plane, but through a 3D cube, a 4D tesseract, or even higher-dimensional spaces!

## Project Vision

The core idea is to create a fully playable N-dimensional Minesweeper game for desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), with a focus on a clean, intuitive user interface for visualizing and navigating these complex spaces.

For a detailed breakdown of the project vision, features, technical stack, and development roadmap, please see our **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md)**.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the planning phase. We have defined the product requirements and are preparing to begin development.

## Contributing

This is an open-ended project. Once development begins, contributions will be welcome. Please refer to the PRD for the planned architecture and roadmap.
